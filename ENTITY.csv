A test may also be executed upon the entity after it is in use to diagnose problems related to the correct functioning of the entity. As such, a test may be executed against a product, a service, or a resource. The tests are divided into three categories: • Pro-active/Controlled. Tests that are established during the fulfillment process on an entity, and are generally run continuously throughout the lifetime of the entity. These tests are often used to establish correct functioning of the entity under test before providing the entity to a consumer. The results of these tests may be queried at any given time. • On-demand/Controlled. Tests that are requested at a specific point in time, but that may also be scheduled to actually execute at a future point in time. These tests are normally run as part of assurance processes; they are used to either detect problems, or to guarantee quality, performance, or reliability commitments made to the consumer of the function provided by the entity under test. These tests are controlled in the sense that they are “managed” and can be suspended, resumed, and for which results may be requested. • On-demand/Uncontrolled. Tests that are requested to execute immediately, and for which the request is blocking until the test completes and returns results in real time. These tests are uncontrolled in that they may not be “managed”.
