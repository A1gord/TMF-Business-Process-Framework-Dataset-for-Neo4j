The formula used is the number of subscribers divided by the number of FTE’s. An examination of public filings for CSP shows that this ratio can vary from less than 250:1 to above 15000:1. The large range for this ratio is caused by a large range in the FTE value for CSPs with similar numbers of subscribers. Providers who make extensive use of out-sourcing or contract employees may have a lower numbers for the FTE than a CSP with a similar number of subscribers. In addition some CSPs offer consulting services to their customers this tends to increase the number of FTEs and hence may make the CSPs appear to have more FTEs than a CSP with a similar number of subscribers. In doing the research on this KPI the authors (and some reviewers) we struck by two things. One as we have already discussed was the large variation in values observed by otherwise similar CSPs. The second observation was that when we superimposed the values for over-the-top (OTT) providers their values for this ratio were consistently near or well above the top end of the range for this metric.,Corporate Management,2021-07-28T20:45:57,Human Resources,,"[Employee], [Subscriber]",1a30a0cd41a711e880d5000d3a02ed0d,,General,DFREED,DFREED,DFREED

Reichheld published a system where respondents were given a value between 0 and 10 based upon the likelihood that they would recommend the CSP (in our case) to a friend. Respondents in the range 0 – 6 were classified as “Detractors”, 7 – 8 as “Passives” and 9 – 10 were “Promoters”.

These include: a decrease of more than 30% in the monthly ARPU or in the case of prepaid subscribers, a decrease for more than 30% in the top-up frequency or rate (not the top-up amount). Other indicators include a decrease in a customer NPS score, late payments of post-paid bills, a decrease in usage, customers experiencing poor network quality (dropped calls, service outages, etc.) or widely publicized cheaper or unique offers from competitors. Another strong indicator of the propensity to churn comes from social media where identifying subscribers soliciting information about termination fees and change over offers can also be a strong indicator of their propensity to churn. There are many formulas for the propensity to churn metric each including many of the factors above with various weightings.
