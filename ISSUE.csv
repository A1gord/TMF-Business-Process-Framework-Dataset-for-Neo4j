Brief Description: Managing the assignment of a value (monetary or other) to an
event or product, or combination (bundle or aggregate) of the above.
Extended Description: The purpose of Charging is to assign a value (monetary or other) to an event or product, or combination (bundle or aggregate) of the above. The charge may be either a credit or a debit. 
The processes involved in assigning a value (charging) and application of the value to a balance include rating, application of discounts, and aggregation.
Rating processes are responsible for calculating the assigned value by multiplying some quantity of items by a price. These processes can be as simple as a price multiplied by a quantity of one or may involve more complex calculations using accumulations or aggregations of items. Prices may be expressed as monetary or other units of measure. Prices are established through mechanisms such as contracts, tariffs, service agreements or price lists. Prices may be affected by the application of discounts.
The values resulting from rating and the application of discounts can then be applied to a customer's balance. The balance affected by the value may be monetary or other balances such as minutes, points, or tokens.
Rating and application of discounts may occur in real-time, near real-time, or may be executed on a periodic basis. These processes will also support pre-paid and post-paid pricing arrangements. 
The charge may appear on a customer invoice via Apply Pricing, Discounting, Adjustments & Rebates.",0,0,0.0,0.0,,,6,EVOLVEADMIN,EVOLVEADMIN,
