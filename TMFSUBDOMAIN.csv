Test strategies can range from simple to complex and encompass the definition of test scenario.
The definition of the test (with specification and rules) is very important because it defines the question that is asked and thus shapes the result that is reported back.
The functionalities include providing:
• Service Test Specification and test scenario management
  - Test scenario management: for example, a home equipment self-test can trigger a test scenario that verifies the functioning of all the services associated, depending on the installed products of the user. Thus, the Box could test its internal configuration and functioning and its capacity to connect to internet and VoIP services.
  - Managing service test capabilities: some resources used to implement services have limited capabilities for executing tests, especially for multiple parallel testing. All the constraints linked to limited resources test capabilities and depending on the execution context must be aggregated and managed at service test level.
  - Managing initiator authorization: some tests are restricted to some user roles (internal or external) so the authorization are defined at the Service Test Strategy and Policy Management
• Test rules defining the strategies for setting up test configuration
• Test rules defining how to carrying out the service test
  - For example: to choose the next test in a scenario depending on the results of the previous tests
• Test rules defining the enrichment of test results. 
  - For example: enrichment of internet bandwidth measure based on installed product
• Test rules defining the restitution of the result depending on test execution context
   - For example: a test result of ok/not ok can be enough for a user whereas customer care requires more details in the result of the test.",20ff99585dcf11ec8107000d3a02ed0d,0,0.0,0,DFREED,DFREED,DFREED
