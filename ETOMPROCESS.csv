Traditionally this process focuses on a future/existing customer perspective.  However, these processes, particularly in today’s digital ecosystem, also do, or should, focus on these from a party, such as a partner, who may offer an enterprise’s offerings to the market and acquire them in some form, either by on-boarding the enterprise’s offerings and fulfilling orders for them directly, or offering them and passing orders on to the enterprise. These parties who represent “consumers” of an enterprise’s offerings and “providers” of enterprise’s offerings move through a similar contact/lead/prospect lifecycle and are targets for an enterprise’s selling process. The parties may be those with whom the business already has a relationship, but represent possible new selling opportunities for an enterprise.

This process interacts with the Party Relationship Development & Retirement process to collect data about a party.

Note: There is no strict rule that a party has to move from contact to lead to prospect and then to the Selling process. A contact could become a prospect.",Reserved for future use.,Reserved for future use.,,,,,DFREED,32,32,

-- Notifying the customer in the event of a disruption (whether reported by the customer or not)
-- Resolving the problem to the customer's satisfaction
-- Providing meaningful status on repair and/or restoration activity
This proactive management also includes working with customers on planned maintenance outages.  
The aim is to have the largest percentage of problems proactively identified and communicated to the customer, to provide meaningful status and to resolve the problem in the shortest timeframe, preferably with no customer impact. The proactive process begins with a network or information technology generated trouble and creating a trouble ticket.  It ends with timely status to the customer and resolution-restoration and/or repair.  A customer repair completion acceptance, as well as a restoration acceptance, when a restoration is involved. This is a basic requirement of the process.  A follow-up contact with the customer to ensure the service repair is working properly should also be made.   The process truly ends with logging all final information and the output of sufficient information to support SLA Reporting and generate outage credits on billing, as appropriate.",Reserved for future use.,"Responsible for receiving trouble reports from customers, resolving them to the customer’s satisfaction and providing meaningful status on repair and/or restoration activity to the customer.","-  Receive trouble notification

• Identifying invoices which are overdue for payment;
• Initiating and managing follow-up with customers having overdue amounts;
• Arranging and monitoring payment plans to allow customers to pay overdue amounts in installments;
• Initiating debt recovery activities in accordance with appropriate commercial practice and policies;
• Managing the aged customer debt portfolio;
• Establishing and managing customer debt profiles to assist in managing debt recovery and debt risk on a customer, product or customer group basis;
• Establishing and managing commercial arrangements with third parties for the recover of aged debt, and/or for the write-off and selling of parts of the debt portfolio to third parties

These processes are responsible for setting Security Management corporate policies, guidelines, best practices and auditing for compliance by the enterprise.  In the information and communications technology (ICT) service provider domain, Security Management is a systematic and continuous series of processes and behaviors which assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Enterprise’s critical ICT assets. For ICT service providers, such assets can also include customer and partner data and resources.  Effective Security Management is essential for an ICT service provider to meet its fiduciary and legal obligations, business/mission objectives, and customer expectations.  Security Management addresses both internal and external sources of security threats as it provides computer network protection and defensive services.  Security Management processes include:1) Prevention;  2) Monitoring ; 3) Analysis; 4) Detection 5) Incident Management.

Security management deals with enterprise exposure to loss of value or reputation through threats or security violations.  Proactive Security Management processes identify areas of threat to the enterprise (covering both internal and external sources of threat), and monitor industry trends and best practice approaches to ensure that the enterprise remains at the forefront of security management threat minimization. Areas of threat can be physical (e.g. break-ins or terrorist incident, inappropriate use of network) or logical (e.g. inappropriate access to and use of information technology). The processes support the categorization and prioritization of areas of threat. These processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and procedures to be followed and provide assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate physical infrastructure, procedures and monitoring capabilities.  Reactive Security management processes deal with the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operation activity, analysis of monitored activity to detect potential threats/security violations, and forensic investigations to determine whether the potential threat is imminent or a security violation has occurred, and the potential or actual perpetrators.

Security Management processes interface to external security, police and/or investigative organizations.  These processes strongly interact with Fraud Management and have common elements and information services and communications specific elements.   Security Management processes are implemented at many levels of the enterprise and at the user, system/network, etc. levels.  Note that the actual security monitoring, control and management procedures and facilities are embedded in the operational infrastructure and processes defined and deployed within the SIP and Operations process areas.

These processes manage all operational processes associated with the storage and distribution of purchased resources and consumable goods from the supplier.  In addition, these processes are responsible for initiating orders for consumable goods, spare parts and for monitoring and reporting on progress of consumable goods orders. The actual order placed is managed through the appropriate S/PRM processes.

These purchased items may be temporarily stored in enterprise, vendor or third party managed warehouses before being delivered to smaller distribution points, or being delivered direct to site.  Or alternatively they may be delivered directly to site from supplier's facilities.  

These processes are responsible for determining the distribution path for individual resources and consumable goods.

These processes are responsible for the internal operational processes associated with managing a warehouse including aspects such as yard management, dock management, pick management, etc.  These processes track all goods stored in the warehouse from the time of inward delivery to outwards dispatch.

These processes manage the co-ordination and control of transport infrastructure, including land, air and sea transport capabilities. The transport may be owned and managed by the enterprise, the vendor or a third-party.  Different parties may be responsible for different aspects of the overall end-end transport requirements, i.e., a vendor may deliver to a warehouse, and a third party from the warehouse to site.

•Establishing and managing a revenue and cost assurance policy framework which is aligned with the overall enterprise goals and objectives
•Developing a framework of controls and KPIs which achieves the defined revenue and cost assurance goals and objectives 
•Gaining enterprise-wide commitment to and knowledge of the framework 
•Regularly reviewing the revenue and cost assurance framework to ensure that its outcomes remain aligned with the enterprise’s objectives

The Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process has a specific responsibility in developing and defining controls and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used for RA, 
in conjunction with operational and other processes elsewhere in the enterprise. 
Where processes elsewhere in the enterprise have an intrinsic capability to instrument their own performance and behavior (as an aspect of operating effectively within the business), 
the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process makes use of this capability, but can also provide guidance to these processes in the form of modified, or additional, KPIs, 
required to support the overall role of Revenue and Cost Assurance . This can involve individual process elements throughout the enterprise (as appropriate for the various aspects of Revenue and Cost Assurance  that apply), or may involve co-ordination across a number of process elements where Revenue and Cost Assurance  acts to provide an integrated or coordinated view of the overall situation. 
With regard to KPI definition, the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process establishes the objectives used to identify the minimum level of satisfactory performance required for a given control point or a process from an RA perspective, and works with other process element in the enterprise to effect this. 
With regard to development of Revenue and Cost Assurance controls, the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process applies policy-based rules that represent the logical definition of comparisons performed on entities, such as bills and call detail records.

• Modifying information in an existing Business Partner order based on feedback of progress from the Business Partner
• Modifying the Business Partner order status;
• Cancelling a Business Partner order  when the specific order requirements are no longer required as notified by the other processes
• Monitoring the jeopardy status of open Business Partner orders, and initiating escalation of Business Partner orders as necessary.

These processes track progress with the Business Partner, either periodically, or at defined points according to a project or program plan. This tracking may be driven from the enterprise, or triggered by reports from the Business Partner (e.g. periodically or at key events). These processes also initiate jeopardy and risk management in relation to the supplied specific resources, services and products, their availability and delivery schedule. 

These processes also manage notifications or requests from parties regarding forced or requested changes to the Business Partner order or delivery schedule. These change requests may be caused by the Business Partner or may be outside its control.  Change requests are sent to the originating  processes where a resolution is agreed.

The Track & Manage Business Partner Order processes will also inform the Close Business Partner Order process by modifying the Business Partner order status to completed when the Business Partner order has been successfully delivered.",Reserved for future use.,Reserved for future use.,,,,,ATALMOR,32,32,

External parties are engaged by the service provider in infrastructure level provisioning-related activities when the service provider has outsourced the relevant infrastructure ownership and management to parties providing this (i.e. outsourced network or IT bureau arrangements).
The actual engagement with the Business Partner is initiated by the specific fulfillment or provisioning enablement processes of the Customer-Ops, Service-Ops or Resource-Ops process layers.
Where Enable Business Partner Requisition Management processes are engaged to manage new and/or modified infrastructure deployment and/or capacity availability, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct deployment and delivery of the requested infrastructure.
For the Business Partner Requisition Management processes the role of the Support Business Partner Requisition Management processes is to make sure that there is sufficient process capacity and capability (for example, information, materials, systems and resources) so that the Business Partner Requisition Management processes can operate effectively. Examples are: information on how to process requisitions for specific Business Partner products, materials needed to confirm requisition requests, systems needed to validate Business Partner product and service availability.
The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
•arranging and managing external Business Partner access to appropriate service provider infrastructure deployment support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
•arranging and managing service provider access to appropriate external Business Partner infrastructure deployment support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
•oversight of Business Partner roll-out, in accordance with approved plans, of the approved new and/or modified infrastructure;
•reporting on deployed external Business Partner resource infrastructure capacity;
•tracking and monitoring of the requested Business Partner infrastructure deployment;
•reporting on Business Partner deployment capability;   
• establishing and managing Business Partner requisition notification facilities and lists to support the Business Partner Requisition Management notification and reporting processes;

This process reuses the Product Offering Pricing processes to manage the lifecycle of the amounts of revenue shared. For example, an enterprise may charge 10 euros for an offering and share a flat 4 euros with another Business Partner, such as an application developer. For configurable offerings the revenue shared may be dependent on those features chosen by the Business Partner who acquires the offering. In this case the revenue shared is also governed by the configuration of the Business Partner's product. A similar case applies to usage based revenue sharing.  Flat rate and usage based revenue sharing models are just two of a number of models, which also include but are not limited to tiered, commitment, progressive, along with multi-Business Partner variations of each. 

Business Partner specific revenue sharing models may be prepared in advance and negotiated  as part of entering into an agreement with a Business Partner to be on-boarded and on-boarding their offerings.",,,,,,,ATALMOR,32,32,

Collections occurs often between larger parties and the collection process is much more complex, since some Parties follows a dynamic late payment strategy. There are multiple process alternatives that may be followed, based on various factors. The process typically includes invoices and reminders including soft dunning letters (multiple wordings), moderate, hard dunning letters, final demand letters.

Party Bill/Invoice Process Management makes certain that there is capability so that the Bill Invoice Management processes can operate effectively. It also designs and develops an enterprises invoicing process.

Party Bill/Invoice Lifecycle Management  generates bills/invoices for products that were provided by an enterprise on behalf of another party. It also receives bills/invoices for products that were provided by another party on an enterprise's behalf. 

Major Differentiation Factors for a separate Invoice Generation: 
• Invoice Timeliness - Generation happen monthly but often also biweekly. In contrast to Retail where it is critical customer's invoice is being generating on time,  (Cost of Infrastructure, ability to re-invoice, apply adjustments) and dependency on reconciliation (often manually externally driven), requires
• Invoice Accuracy – The tolerance for accepting differences between the balance of two invoices is much higher than for retail. By implication checks and balances

The Invoice document does not summarize to total outstanding payment or payments due. The Bill contains the payment due date and Balance.

For example, an enterprise may charge a fee to another party for collecting payments based on sales of the party's offerings in an enterprise's marketplace. Events can also include the need for periodic billing of a recurring product rate. For example, a listing fee charged to another party that lists its products in an enterprise's market place.

Ranges may be expressed in percentages or some other quantitative measure that an enterprise will use to negotiate the aspects of a Business Partner revenue sharing model.  For example, for a flat rate revenue sharing model an enterprise may be willing to share 70% of the product offering price with another Business Partner. The range can be based on the processes that an enterprise and a Business Partner provide. For example, if an enterprise only accepts an order for an offering while a Business Partner performs all other processes, such as fulfilling the order, accepting payment for it, and billing for it, it may be willing to share up to 90 percent of the revenue it receives for the offering.

More complex ranges, such as for tiered and progressive revenue sharing models may be based on policy defined by an enterprise. For example, a tiered model may have a range of 60-70% revenue share for up to 100 product offerings acquired and a range of 80-90% for above 100 offerings. Ranges may also include a range of prices for an offering paired with revenue sharing ranges.

This modular approach helps focus on goals-based, results-driven KPIs that guide the customer and help them reap benefits from the use of the Service Provider’s products. Defining customer journeys also provides a more clear set of milestones and goals to benchmark customer progress.
The overall scope of the CLM process encompasses the entire organization, which generally brings all sources of static and dynamic data, marketing processes, and value-added services to a unified decision supporting platform through iterative phases of customer acquisition, retention, cross- and upselling, and lapsed customer win-back.
Processes are put into place to support customers, therefore the first step is to understand customers in several dimensions, including:
•{T}The customer needs
•{T}The customer processes
•{T}Customer ""events,"" where the customer comes into contact with the organization
•{T}The experience that the customer values

The next step is to work forward from the customer to define the organization’s processes. This approach builds the customer’s view into the process; it ensures that the process delivers the experience—and the value—that the customer wants.
Value is essentially determined by the customer. Therefore, process design begins with the customer’s viewpoint, an understanding of what the customer truly values, and an understanding of the new communications technologies and value-added services that provide customer value.
The benefits of a customer-driven approach cross all levels of an organization, from increased employee satisfaction to increased shareholder value. A customer-driven approach fosters the development of customer-focused processes and helps instill ownership of processes by allowing individuals to own and solve their own needs. This enables better alignment of responsibility and accountability with authority. This alignment also creates an environment where the focus can be on performance drivers, because the individual’s performance is in direct relationship to the company performance.",,,,,ATALMOR,ATALMOR,DFREED,,,

The objective of the Migration Assurance is to assure that:
• Data cleaning is performed before the migration to new/modified systems/platforms
• Legacy customizations for business scenarios are correctly mapped in COTS platforms
• Business Assurance test scenarios are defined and executed before the production
• Post migration Business Assurance test scenarios between old and new environments data defined and executed after production
• Historical data accessibility is implemented before the production
• Guarantee that data access policies remain according with the defined policies, when making it accessible to the right stakeholders in the new repositories
• Assure that all structured relationships and incurring operations between existing and newly deployed platforms are performing as initially designed to support the process dependency (ex: mediation migration to deliver data to billing)
• Migrated data interpretation support implemented before production 
• Users and customers (self-service) training on new migrated data interpretation implemented before production
• Users don’t experience outages or delays in receiving their provisioned services
• Service delivery interruptions due to errors during platform service and customer migration, are minimized",,,,,ATALMOR,ATALMOR,DFREED,,,

It is integrated with project management disciplines, such as forming teams, scheduling all event management tasks, monitoring tasks, and so forth.

An event may be for internal or external parties, accompany a new product line, offering, campaign, and so forth.

Customer interactions may be short lived ( such as in the case of  a query that is answered immediately ) or may take long time to complete (such as in the case of complex orders or requests concerning back office intervention). When interactions are long the process is in charge of making sure the customer is notified in a timely manner about the progress of her request. Customer interaction history may be used by BI systems in order to gather information about customer profile and satisfaction.   Customer interactions can span over multiple channels (such as: phone calls, web self service and devices.) each party involved in the interaction has a role that mandates its credentials. For some interactions users may need to login/authenticate themselves in order to get the appropriate role.",Not used for this process element.,Reserved for future use.,eHealth:  Coordinate customer participation in commissioning or end-to-end testing and satisfactory delivery.

This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie “instantiated”) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.","The objective of Tool Policy Management is to provide oversight to the entire lifecycle of a fraud tool or solution within the organization.  This includes several key components:

1. Identification of the need for a tool or solution.  This will include the creation of business case materials needed to support the need for investment in technology to replace manual operations or enhance volumes of data being analyzed, etc.  This process will also be the origination point for requirements vetting, collecting, and aggregation into RFx issuance, and the subsequent review and scoring of responses received.
2. Deployment scope and project management of any tool or solution.  While the operator often contains an internal PMO for deployment activities/oversight, actual requirements needed by the Fraud program must be represented and ensured by the policy process. 
3. Staff preparation.  Use of technology requires training in both the use of the technology and the fraud domain itself to understand rules and processes being employed by tools.  The policy process must identify and maintain the necessary staff requirements to operate tools to the full extent of their deployed capabilities.
4. Ongoing process and rule enhancement.  Tools are subject to modifications and enhancements necessary to address constant changes within the fraud environment.  The policy process must maintain guidelines on when rules and processes may be enhanced or updated.
5. Access to fraud tools and systems.  Tools within the fraud environment have access to particularly sensitive information that require increased levels of security.  Policies must be in place to determine who is allowed access to these tools, and specifically, what actions they are allowed to perform within these fraud tools.  For example, configuration of rules for detection should be performed by appropriate staff to ensure fair yet thorough application of any given rule.  General staff within an organization should not have access to this information or configuration capability.
6. Roadmap development.  As needs of the fraud program change, tool support inevitably must also evolve.  In cases where tool capabilities do not meet the needs for growth, requirements for enhancements must be maintained within the policy process, and made available to tool developers and/or to subsequent RFx issuing.  It is important to examine existing tools within other departments for possible integration or re-use as part of this process.",Reserved for future use.,Reserved for future use.,,,,,DFREED,32,32,

Earlier processing and/or analysis of datasets enables not only more rapid detection of fraud, but also the subsequent ability to take meaningful action to stop fraudulent activities before (any) damage is incurred by the business.  There are 3 primary functional areas within this process to address and define:

1. Rule Processing:  During rule processing activities, information and data is passed through rules either through automated (technology-based) means or other manual processes.  Depending on the volume of data and the complexity of the rules (interdependencies, aggregated or weighted triggering, etc.), increasing levels of technology will be necessary to quickly implement rules against data and determine the results.
2. Alert Generation:  Configuration of alerts.  Alerts may be generated when certain expected conditions are not met, including missing dataset delivery, failure to act on investigation requests (escalations), etc.  Alerts may also be issued when certain conditions are exceeded, including excessive alarm quantities resulting from “loose” rules producing false positive results.
3. Alarm Generation:  Configuration of alarms.  Alarms are typically the result of detected events or activities that are suspicious and should be investigated as possible fraud.  Alarms may be the result of single rule violations, or of multiple rule violations that contribute to weighted levels of suspicion (more complex scenario) etc.

Other functions may also include the configuration of supplementary reports for scenarios not configured through rules and alarms as listed above.

This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie “instantiated”) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.","Fraud Analysis is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities conducted by the analysis team.  Each sub process is part of a linear flow that also includes feedback into action and support processes, as described below.

1. Alarm Assessment:  As data processing triggers alarms of suspected fraud, the assessment activity is the first point at which initial triage of the alarm(s) is conducted.   During the assessment, the analyst should determine, based on business rules, the initial validity of the alarm, a priority of the alarm (based on value, affected systems, or other criteria), and the appropriate team that would need to address the alarm (e.g., billing, wholesale partner, network, etc.).
2. Alarm Investigation:  Once initial assessment has occurred, the alarm is then forwarded to an investigation activity that typically begins as an internal function.   During investigation additional data may be accessed, scope of the issue may be ascertained, and an overall understanding of the issue will need to be achieved before determining whether the issue is, in fact, fraud.  During this process initial actions may be invoked (e.g., disrupted service) to prevent further loss/risk prior to customer contact and/or fraud determination work.
3. Contact Customer:  Once internal investigations have gathered all information available, a customer contact may be necessary to understand customer intention, validity of the subscriber, etc.  This is the final process performed prior to reaching a fraud decision.  If no customer is directly involved, this step may not be necessary (e.g., Dealer Fraud, Internal Fraud).
4. Fraud Determination:  Once all information is collected from internal and external investigations, a fraud determination is made.  If the decision is that the issue is not fraud, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Fraud Actions process (1.2.3) for closure, and the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to possibly avoid recurrence of this alarm condition.  If the decision is that the issue is, in fact fraud, similar subsequent activities will occur:  First, the issue is referred to the Fraud Actions (1.2.3) process to properly handle actions to stop the fraud, initiate collections and legal actions, etc.  Second, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to hotlists, blacklists, and any refinement needed to possibly capture the issue more rapidly.
5. Recording and Reporting:  After the determination is made as fraud or not fraud, activities associated with the analysis are finally passed into recording of actions, and reporting of recoveries, time to capture and correct, and preventative actions now in process.",Reserved for future use.,Reserved for future use.,,,,,ATALMOR,32,32,

This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie “instantiated”) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.","Fraud Actions is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities to be performed based on the issue being determined as fraud or not fraud.  Each sub process is capable of being a stand-alone process (not dependent on other Actions sub processes), however more than one of these Actions may be used to help bring any given issue to appropriate closure.

1. No Action:  If an issue is determined to not be fraud, the issue is closed and archived as part of this process.  Concurrent flows to Support and Reporting have also occurred to adjust rules, etc., as a result.  No further action is required.  Note:  A feedback to the System Configuration Management process should be considered in this case, for possible alarm threshold adjustment, whitelist updates, etc.  This process path is denoted in Figure 5:  “Overall Process”.
2. Adjust Customer Billing:  Certain fraud instances result in customers being the victim in addition to the operator.  In these cases, extent of customer damage needs to be quickly ascertained and corrected in the customer’s billing and/or services.  While the determination of the damage is typically performed by the fraud team, the actual Customer Billing corrective action is usually performed by a Customer Care Team, based on information forwarded by the Fraud Team.
3. Legal or LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Action:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and significant financial loss, contract breach, or other illegal activities have occurred, the operator may seek recourse via the legal system.  This may be via civil reparations and/or criminal charges.  This sub process will utilize the operator’s policies (1.1.5) to determine whether attorney, law enforcement, or other assistance is needed.  This sub process will also use the same policies to determine and collect supporting information that will be necessary for those external agencies to properly pursue their activities.
4. Terminate Customer:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and the operator deems the issue to be of enough magnitude to warrant termination, this process will conduct the termination of the customer (e.g., initiate the disconnect order).
5. Dismiss Staff:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and/or a substantial violation of internal operator policies and internal staff have been found responsible, termination of the staff may be initiated at this step.  Fraud team findings for ethics policy violations, fraud investigative results, etc., should be forwarded to Human Resources, where appropriate actions will be initiated.  Of important note:  Staff negligence resulting in fraud is sometimes inappropriately diagnosed as intentional when, in fact, accidental actions may have exposed the operator to the fraud.  Care should be taken to fully understand the circumstances around which the internal employee’s actions caused or help cause the fraud.  
6. Process Change:  If an issue is determined to be fraud, future preventative steps may include business process change in addition to fraud detection rule enhancements.  Business process may have, in fact, allowed the fraud to occur, therefore the first step in prevention should happen well before a rule should capture the condition.  This process will need to interface with the business to identify candidates for process change and present those to the appropriate business stakeholders.",Reserved for future use.,Reserved for future use.,,,,,ATALMOR,32,32,

Initiate and complete business agreements with a Party or parties, to allow the delivery of business and technical capabilities required by the enterprise. For example, through these processes, the enterprise might contract with a supplier of a third-generation mobile network and put in place links between the IT Systems of the Party and the enterprise, ready to allow specific processes and product offerings to be developed. Another example might be contracts for the supply of personal computers or office supplies for the enterprise.

This process is  also responsible for the establishment of commercial agreements between the enterprise and external parties/providers on B2B frameworks and interactions.

Party Agreement Management also manages the on-going arrangements and processes between the enterprise and the selected Party, and manage the periodic agreement on specifications for deliverables within the context of the negotiated agreement.

This process particularly applies when the commercial arrangements between parties exist over an extended period, and the commercial agreement allows for the on-going specification of deliverables within the period of the commercial agreement.
