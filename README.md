# TMF Business Process Framework Dataset for Neo4j

The dataset is a Neo4j knowledge graph based on [TMF](https://www.tmforum.org/) Business Process Framework v22.0 data.  
CSV files contain data about the model entities, and the [JSON file](https://github.com/A1gord/TMF-Business-Process-Framework-Dataset-for-Neo4j/blob/main/neo4j_importer_model.json) contains knowledge graph mapping.  
The script used to generate CSV files based on the XML model can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NeCpB1juofK04Ntbdtvy5Uv4W_ZZFHar?usp=sharing).
