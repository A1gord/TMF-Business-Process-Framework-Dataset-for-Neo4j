The Service Provider is bounded by its Suppliers’ ability to deliver.

Note that individual enterprises can adopt multiple roles in different value networks. For example a service provider may be the customer-facing service provider in one value network and a complementor or intermediary in another. In today’s fast-moving marketplace, these relationships can be very short-lived compared with the more static relationships of the traditional telecommunications market.
The implications of eBusiness developments, and how these are supported by eTOM, are discussed in a separate Application Note.",0.0,0.0,,,,ADMIN,ADMIN,ADMIN
